Elevator
Responses
English [16]: Stav wants to check whether the code was properly corrected. She goes into the elevator on the 0 ground floor and presses all the buttons together. It is expected that the elevator will rise and open at each floor. Write a pseudo code loop that passes all the floors in ascending order from floor 0 and opens the door on each floor.
