Years of experience,Are you familiar with this game?,What do you think the interface does?,What is the purpose of hours parameter?,Implement the interface.,"The implementation includes a function make_turn(int row, int col) What do you think it does?","What is the purpose of the ""row"" parameter?","What is the purpose of the ""col"" parameter?","The implementation includes a function make_turn(int row, int col) What do you think it does?","What is the purpose of the ""row"" parameter?","What is the purpose of the ""col"" parameter?","The implementation contains a function arrangeFilesByName(files)  In your opinion, what does it do?",What is the role of the parameter?  What is its type?,What do you think it returns?,"What do you think  profit (units, cost, price)  function does?","What is the purpose of the ""units"" parameter?","What is the purpose of the ""cost"" parameter?","What is the purpose of the ""price"" parameter?",What does this code do?,Stav wants to check whether the code was properly corrected. She goes into the elevator on the 0 ground floor and presses all the buttons together. It is expected that the elevator will rise and open at each floor.
